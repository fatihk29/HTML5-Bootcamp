    <h1>HyperText Markup Language</h1>
    <p>
        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML <br />
        is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
        a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style
        Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

    <h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
    <p>
        CSS allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work
        under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax
        example and also covers some key terms about the language.

    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
        Our JavaScript Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both.
        JavaScript is used to create client-side dynamic pages. JavaScript is an
        object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.
        JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language.
        The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for
        translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.
